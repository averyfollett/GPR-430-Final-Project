Note: This is an improvement on an older project made entirely in blueprints that used a 3rd part plugin for networking.
Our contributions are only in Main_Menu_Level and Level_1_CPP, the rest are leftovers.

How to Play:
- Open two instances of the game on the same computer (if launching in editor, set # of players to 2 and play mode to Standalone Game and play from the main menu)
- On one instance, press Play, then Host (as no sessions will be found)
- On the other instance, press Play, then Join once it finds the existing session
- Once in the game, the controls (below) are simple
- The goal of the game is for both players to work together to restore power to each room in the research station
- As you complete each room, the door will open allowing you to proceed

Controls:
- WASD to move your character
- E to pick up and put down the generator (the small glowing sphere)
- ENTER or T to chat, ENTER to send

Pressure plate: stand on it to enable power
Generator outlet: place the generator on the outlet to enable power
Rotating wires: press E while standing at the wire to rotate it, align with existing wires to enable power
